## Credits
Full credits for the work of Cransitz and jubi. I found this script from the Blender Stack exchange here: https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/107365/align-camera-to-view-precisely-and-automatically-without-manual-fiddling but it didn't work with the latest versions of Blender 2.93 so I updated it to work with Blender 2.93+.

## Permissions
AlignCameraToView is under the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal that means you have permission to use part or the whole of this plugin for free or commercial purposes free of charge.
This add on is completely free what I want is for the most people to benefit from this and that's enough to make me smile.

## What does AlignCameraToView do?
AlignCameraToView is a free Blender Plugin when you press "Align Camera To View" it will set the location of the active camera to the scene camera (same as Ctrl + Alt + Numpad 0) but also change the resolution of the camera and the focal length to match the scene camera exactly.

After you have done this you may want to change the resolution afterwards or increase the Resolution % under the Output settings if you want a higher resolution because the scene camera can be quite low/high resolution sometimes a lot smaller/bigger than even standard hd 1920 x 1080.

## How do you use AlignCameraToView?
1. In the scene properties tab set the Active Camera to the camera you want to set to match all the settings of the Scene Camera.
2. Press n to toggle hide/show of the properties panel > Align > Press Align Camera to View and you're done.
